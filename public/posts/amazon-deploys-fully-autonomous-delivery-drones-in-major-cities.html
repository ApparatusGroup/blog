      <p>Amazon has launched commercial drone delivery service in 10 major metropolitan areas, marking the first large-scale deployment of autonomous aerial delivery in the United States. The service promises delivery times under 30 minutes for millions of Prime members.</p>
<p><strong>Fleet Specifications</strong></p>
<p>The hexacopter drones can carry packages up to 5 pounds across a 15-mile radius, utilizing advanced computer vision and LiDAR for obstacle avoidance. Each aircraft incorporates redundant propulsion systems and parachute deployment for emergency landings.</p>
<p>Operating autonomously from neighborhood micro-fulfillment centers, drones follow optimized flight paths that avoid airports, schools, and sensitive areas. The system automatically adjusts for weather conditions and grounds flights when wind speeds exceed safe thresholds.</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Approval</strong></p>
<p>The FAA granted Amazon expanded Part 135 certification after years of safety demonstrations and pilot programs. The approval includes beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) operations, a significant regulatory milestone that other companies are now pursuing.</p>
<p>Each drone flight is monitored by remote operators who can intervene if automated systems detect anomalies, though intervention rates currently average less than 0.1% of flights.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Results</strong></p>
<p>Early metrics show 94% on-time delivery rates with zero safety incidents during the first month of operations. Customer satisfaction scores exceed traditional delivery methods, with users particularly appreciating real-time tracking and precise delivery windows.</p>
<p>Amazon processes over 10,000 drone deliveries daily across the initial cities, with plans to expand to 50 cities by year-end. The company reports significant reductions in last-mile delivery costs and carbon emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive Response</strong></p>
<p>Walmart, UPS, and several startups have announced accelerated timelines for their drone delivery programs following Amazon's successful launch.</p>
