A fusion reactor operated by Commonwealth Fusion Systems has achieved net positive energy output, producing 1.5 times more energy than required to initiate the fusion reaction. The milestone represents a turning point in the decades-long quest for clean fusion power.

**Technical Achievement**

The compact tokamak design uses high-temperature superconducting magnets to confine plasma at 150 million degrees Celsius—ten times hotter than the sun's core. The reactor sustained fusion conditions for 12 seconds, sufficient to demonstrate commercial viability.

Unlike previous experiments that achieved momentary fusion, this reactor maintained stable plasma conditions long enough to extract useful heat for electricity generation. Engineers successfully converted fusion heat to steam, driving turbines to produce grid-ready power.

**Energy Output**

The test generated 20 megawatts of fusion power while consuming 13 megawatts to operate the magnetic confinement system, marking humanity's first clear net energy gain from fusion. Researchers project scaling the design could yield gigawatt-level output sufficient to power cities.

The breakthrough relied on novel magnet technology that creates magnetic fields twice as strong as previous systems, enabling a more compact reactor footprint. This smaller design dramatically reduces construction costs compared to massive experimental reactors.

**Commercial Timeline**

Commonwealth Fusion plans to build a demonstration power plant producing 100 megawatts by 2028, with commercial reactors entering service in the early 2030s. The company has secured $2 billion in funding from energy companies and governments.

Unlike fission reactors, fusion produces no long-lived radioactive waste and cannot undergo meltdown, addressing major public safety concerns about nuclear power.

**Global Impact**

The achievement could revolutionize global energy systems, providing abundant carbon-free baseload power. Utilities are reassessing long-term energy strategies in light of fusion's commercial feasibility.

International research institutions are accelerating their fusion programs, while renewable energy advocates caution against over-reliance on any single technology for decarbonization.
