      <p>Apple has unveiled the Apple Vision Pro 2, augmented reality glasses that the company positions as the eventual replacement for smartphones. The sleek device projects high-resolution displays directly onto lenses, controlled entirely through eye tracking and hand gestures.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware Innovation</strong></p>
<p>Weighing just 85 grams, the titanium-framed glasses look nearly identical to conventional eyewear while packing micro-OLED displays, spatial audio, and neural processing chips. Battery life reaches a full day of typical use, with wireless charging built into the carrying case.</p>
<p>The glasses employ advanced eye-tracking technology that understands where users are looking with millimeter precision, enabling interface navigation through natural gaze patterns. Hand gesture recognition works reliably at distances up to 3 feet from the device.</p>
<p><strong>Software Ecosystem</strong></p>
<p>Apple has redesigned iOS specifically for spatial computing, with apps that float in users' field of view and scale dynamically based on context. Developers can create experiences that blend digital content with the physical world, from virtual workspace monitors to interactive gaming.</p>
<p>The device integrates seamlessly with existing Apple services, displaying iMessage conversations, email, and notifications as hovering windows that follow users' gaze. Video calls project life-size avatars that maintain eye contact through intelligent rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Features</strong></p>
<p>LED indicators alert nearby people when cameras are active, addressing previous concerns about surreptitious recording. All visual processing occurs on-device, with encrypted cloud sync as an opt-in feature.</p>
<p><strong>Market Impact</strong></p>
<p>Priced at $1,999, the Vision Pro 2 targets early adopters and professionals. Apple reports pre-orders exceeded first-year production capacity within 48 hours. Industry analysts project AR glasses could capture 30% of the smartphone market within a decade.</p>
<p>The device launches in 15 countries next month, with expanded availability planned for Q4.</p>
