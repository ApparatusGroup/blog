      <p>Meta has announced a complete pivot toward decentralized social networking with the launch of "Meta.Social," a blockchain-based platform that gives users full ownership of their data and content. The move represents a dramatic shift in the company's business model.</p>
<p><strong>Platform Architecture</strong></p>
<p>Built on a custom proof-of-stake blockchain, Meta.Social allows users to own their social graphs, posts, and interactions as cryptographic assets. The platform enables content portability across different applications and guarantees that user data cannot be unilaterally deleted or modified by the company.</p>
<p>Each user account is secured by a self-custody wallet, with optional social recovery mechanisms to prevent account lockouts. The system implements end-to-end encryption for direct messages and offers granular privacy controls for public content.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Model</strong></p>
<p>Meta plans to monetize the platform through optional creator subscriptions and a marketplace for digital collectibles, abandoning its traditional advertising model. Early adopters receive platform tokens that grant governance rights over protocol upgrades and content moderation policies.</p>
<p>Content creators can monetize directly through microtransactions, with the platform taking a modest 5% fee compared to traditional social media's indirect advertising cut. High-quality content is algorithmically rewarded with platform tokens.</p>
<p><strong>Industry Impact</strong></p>
<p>The announcement has sparked intense debate about the future of social media, with competitors scrambling to develop blockchain strategies. Privacy advocates have cautiously welcomed the move while expressing concerns about scalability and environmental impact.</p>
<p>Meta.Social enters beta testing next month with 100,000 invited users, expanding to millions by year-end.</p>
